### Prerequisites.

- So I started by installing [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and [NVM](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows).
- node --version 18.5.0

#### UI5 Tooling
- Now a new project needs the UI5 tooling, so the below steps configures them for this project
- Installed UI5 CLI globally, but can be installed for the project as well,
- Created a `webapp` folder,
- generated the `package.json` file,
- generated the `ui5.yml`,
- copied and created a `manifest.json` file from [here](https://sapui5.hana.ondemand.com/sdk/#/topic/be0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da.html#loiobe0cf40f61184b358b5faedaec98b2da/section_example).
- get the sapui5 dependencies for UI5 version 1.103.1
